## To run the app:

- write in the terminal : docker-compose up
- There are services
  1- frontend
  2- backend

## After the backend service is up please excute this command to seed the database:

- docker exec -it <backend_container_name> npm run seed

## KeyFeatures of the backend:

- Enables efficient search and retrieval based on user preferences.
- Database Integration:
- Powered by MongoDB with Mongoose for schema-based data modeling and validation.
- Seeding Functionality:
- Includes a seeding mechanism to populate the database with test data for development or demonstration purposes.

## key Features of the frontend:

- apartment listing with different sorting (most-recent-recomended..)
- areas listing with different sorting (most-recent-recomended..)
- projects listing with different sorting (most-recent-recomended..)
